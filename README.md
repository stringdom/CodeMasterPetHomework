Create an abstract Pet class that has abstract functionality (at least 3 methods).
It must have a "string Name" read-only porperty that is filled by a parameter to the ctor.
At least one of the methods must take in parameters, and at least one of the methods must return a value instead of printing things to the console.

Create four implementations of the Pet class that all appropriately implement the different methods.

Allow the user to enter zero to many pets (can be any type) and store them into a `List<Pet>` object.

After the user is done entering in pets, allow the user to:

1. Select a pet.
2. Perform an operation.
You will have to collect the arguments from the user required to invoke a method that has parameters.
3. Repeat 1-2 until the user decides to quit.
